# stash-empornium

This script by user humbaba allows torrent files and associated presentations to be created for empornium based on scenes from a local [stash][1] instance.

[1]: https://github.com/stashapp/stash

## Installation

### Using Docker

The docker version is recommended as it comes bundled with all required and recommended backend dependencies. To run the backend as a docker container, copy and paste the following commands:

```bash
docker pull bdbenim/stash-empornium:latest
docker run -d \
--name stash-empornium \
-p 9932:9932 \
--mount type=bind,src=/path/to/config,target=/config \
--mount type=bind,src=/path/to/save/torrents,target=/torrents \
--mount type=bind,src=/media,target=/media \
bdbenim/stash-empornium:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that the target for your `/media` mount matches what stash sees. You may have to change the target, not just the source, to achieve this.

You can configure additional mount points by copying the same syntax as above. This may be useful if your stash library uses multiple directory locations. When in doubt, refer to the File Info tab of the scene in stash to get the file path as stash sees it:

### Without Using Docker

The backend can also be run directly by intalling its dependencies and running the python script.

#### Backend Dependencies

- Python3
  - flask
  - requests
  - vcsi
  - configupdater
  - cairosvg
  - waitress (optional)
  - redis (optional)
- ffmpeg
- mktorrent
- mediainfo (optional)

Run the following commands to install the backend and dependencies (may vary slightly by OS):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bdbenim/stash-empornium.git
cd stash-empornium
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg mktorrent
```

You can optionally install waitress as a production WSGI server:

```bash
pip install waitress
```

### Userscript

#### Dependencies

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)

Currently the script does not work with other userscript managers, though this may change in the future.

The userscript can be installed [here][2]. Place the other files on the same machine as your stash server and ensure dependencies are installed.

[2]: https://github.com/bdbenim/stash-empornium/raw/main/emp_stash_fill.user.js

## Configuration

1. Visit `upload.php` and open the Tampermonkey menu. Set the backend URL, stash URL, and API key (if you use authentication).

2. Update config file located at `config/config.ini`:

```ini
[backend]
## name of a file in templates/ dir
default_template = fakestash-v2
## where torrents are placed
torrent_directory = /home/foobar/torrents
## port that the backend listens on
port = 9932

[stash]
## url of your stash instance
url = http://localhost:9999
## only needed if you set up authentication for stash
# api_key = 123abc.xyz
```

The port above corresponds to the backend URL in step 1, so if you change one you must change the other.

### Redis

The backend server can be configured to connect to an optional [redis][3] server. This is not required for any of the functionality of the script, but it allows image URLs to be cached even when restarting the backend, speeding up the upload process whenever an image is reused (e.g. performer images, studio logos). If redis is not used, these URLs will still be cached in memory for as long as the server is running.

Connection settings can be specified in the `[redis]` configuration section:

```ini
[redis]
host = localhost
port = 6379
username = stash-empornium
password = stash-empornium
ssl = false
```

Any unused options can simply be omitted.

## Usage

1. Run `emp_stash_fill.py`
2. Get scene ID (it's in the url, e.g. for `http://localhost:9999/scenes/4123` the scene id is `4123`)
3. Go to `upload.php` and enter the scene ID in the "Fill from stash" box
4. Select the file you want if you have multiple files attached to that scene, tick/untick the generate screens box, pick template if you have defined others
5. Click "fill from" and wait as the tedious parts of the upload process are done for you. Status messages should appear and instructions for final steps. Performer tags like `pamela.anderson` will be generated for you, along with resolution tags and url tags of the studio, e.g. `1080p` and `brazzers.com`
6. You still need to load the torrent file (the location on your filesystem will be given to you) into the form, set a category, optionally check for dupes if you didn't do so manually. Also load the torrent file into your client (you can configure the torrent output directory to be a watch dir for your torrent client) and make sure the media file is visible to your torrent client
7. When you're satisfied everything is ready, upload

### Command Line Arguments

The script can be run with optional command line arguments, most of which override a corresponding configuration file option. These can be used to quickly change a setting without needing to modify the config file, such as for temporarily listening on a different port or saving torrent files in a different directory. Not all configuration options can currently be set via the command line. The available options are described in the script's help text below:

```text
usage: emp_stash_fill.py [-h] [--configdir CONFIGDIR] [-t TORRENTDIR] [-p PORT] [-c] [-d] [-f] [-r] [--version] [-q | -v | -l LEVEL] [--rhost RHOST] [--rport RPORT] [--username USERNAME]
                         [--password PASSWORD] [--use-ssl] [--flush]

## Templates

This repository includes default templates which can be used to fill in the presentation based on data from stash. Currently there are two, however more may be added in the future.

### Adding Templates

To add a new template, save it in the `templates` directory alongside your `config.ini` file. Then add it to your configuration with the following format:

```ini
[templates]
filename = description
```

Templates are written using Jinja syntax. The available variables are:

- audio_bitrate
- audio_codec
- bitrate
- contact_sheet
- container
- cover
- date
- details
- duration
- framerate
- image_count
- media_info (if `mediainfo` is installed)
- performers
  - name
  - details
    - image_remote_url
    - tag
- resolution
- screens
- sex_acts
- studio
- studio_logo
- title
- video_codec

Refer to the default templates for examples of how they are used.

### Custom Lists

In addition to the template variables described above, additional tag lists may be added to the `empornium` config section by following the format of the `sex_acts` variable. These will automatically be parsed and made available to any custom templates as comma-separated lists. For instance, you may wish to add a section called `performer_attributes` to describe characteristics of performers in the scene.

## Titles

Similarly to templates, the title has a few options for formatting. This uses python's builtin string formatter, so variable names are enclosed in braces (`{}`) within the string. The default title format is:

```python
[{studio}] {performers} - {title} ({date})[{resolution}]
```

This would result in something like this:

> [Blender Institute] Big Buck Bunny, Frank, Rinky, Gimera - Big Buck Bunny \(2008-05-10)[1080p]

The available variables that can be used are:

- codec
- date
- duration
- framerate
- performers
- resolution
- studio
- title

### Title Templates

Beginning with `v0.7.0`, the `title_template` config option has been added, which extends the title formatting capability using jinja templates. With this system, the equivalent to the earlier example is:

```python
{% if studio %}[{{studio}}] {% endif %}{{performers|join(', ')}}{% if performers %} - {% endif %}{{title}} {% if date %}({{date}}){% endif %}[{{resolution}}]
```

This system has the added advantage of builtin `if` statements, `for` loops, and many other features. The above example uses these to ensure that there are no empty square brackets if the scene's studio is not set, nor empty parentheses around a missing date. Since the resolution is determined by the script, this will always be available. The same variables are available to this setting as the `title_default` option, with some minor differences:

- `performers` will be provided as a list rather than a single comma-separated string. This allows more control over how the list will be formatted, but the above example shows how to keep the same comma-separated list formatting.
- `framerate` does not include "fps" in the string, again for more flexibility in the template
